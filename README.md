# Overview
A simple PHP web app with a MySQL backend datastore, running locally on Apache HTTP Server. This was the final project of my Data Driven Webpages course that I completed as part of my Computer Programming degree in college. The application page hierarchy and interface was provided with the instructions for the project; thus this is mostly a basic demonstration of how to implement Models, Views, and Controllers in PHP. My plan is to eventually experiment with a more advanced example using the same core technologies, but built from the ground up with a custom frontend and the addition of more advanced features (i.e. Implement with Docker, include a frontend JavaScript framework, etc.). Any updates I have regarding that project I will be sure to reflect here.
